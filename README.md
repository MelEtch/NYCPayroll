Open Source Data Analysis
In order to earn experience in sourcing public data, I completed a project for Career Foundry that included
- selecting a public open source data set
- cleaning it and preparing it for introductory analysis
- exploring the data in Python
- building visualizations including maps, time series, and cluster analysis.
- creating a dashboard in Tableau based on the open-ended data exploration but resulting in actual recommendations.

Challenge:  Taking an unknown data set and learning as much as possible about the data in order to propose business questions that could be answered, then answering those questions and providing recommendations.

Solution:  Use New York City Citywide Payroll Data which provides salary information for city employees across the five boroughs of New York City.  Clean, explore, and analyze the data in Python, using Jupyter Notebook and Anaconda. Identify potential business questions and audience that would be interested in understanding :
- Which Agencies offer the most jobs?
- Which Agencies pay the most in terms of Regular Pay and Overtime Pay?
- Where are these Agencies located?
Build a dashboard in Tableau to communicate findings and recommendations to an audience of Job Seekers.
